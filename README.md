## Hide my Gmail
I always have my gmail open and I am on video calls / meetings almost everday and more often than not I sometimes click on my gmail tab. 
Sometimes, I have revealed emails that are not meant to be seen for some reasons 

So, I made this extension for myself (might publish). With no prior experience with Javascript it took me around an hour to put this together (thanks to chatgpt's help)

### Here's how you can try it :
1. Download the code
2. Copy and paste `chrome://extensions` in your browser
3. Find **load unpacked** button on top left of your screen
4. Upload the folder you downloaded in part 1
5. Open a Gmail tab in the same browser and click on the extension icon

### How it looks after you click on extension

### To add next : 
- [ ] replace sender's name by movie title and title of email by famous movie quote 
- [ ] add an extension logo 
- [ ] when switching between like Primary, Social, Promotions etc it should retain hidden-ness
